LOESS was easily configured and was fairly accurate in tracing the temperature rise and falls. I got better results with LOESS
because it was extremely hard to tune to create the appropriate results. LOESS was more independent but less prone to encapsulating
some outrageous datapoints whilst due to the time spent tuning on Kalman it tried to portray more about the data than LOESS which is probably better. 


These features like elevation, course and timestamp might prove better at computing the direction and pace which could give us
more accurate subsequent lat/lon values. The elevation could also account for changes in speed for the transition_covariance that might be 
able to find tune the data a little more. I personally feel what I have got with the gpx path is good enough.
