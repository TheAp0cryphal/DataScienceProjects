1. Not Necessarily, there are a lot of other factors that contribute to daily temperatures. This might be true locally but 
for example Sahara desert has a high temperature level, but does it mean it is densely populated? No. Similarly, people
prefer living in warmer climates so it does not explain much in my opinion.

2. File compression is necessary for space conservation and easy transmission of data. We work with datas that are in Gigabytes
of magnitude. The minor tradeoff for decompressing on runtime seems a better choice rather than working with that data.
It might be faster in a sense that the overall process of data handling is improved with compressed files rather than uncompressed, although
processing time might be slower.
