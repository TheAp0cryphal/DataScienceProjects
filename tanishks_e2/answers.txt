Q1.
This equation is a representation of y = mx+c where c is the intercept and m is the slope and x is the input data.
The line linearly regresses to find a best fit line. Linear Regression is a method to find correlation between scattered data points.

Q2.
First we parsed the dates from the datafile, then converted these dates to the timestamp. In essence, they are basically the same data but 
one is datetime type and other is float. The linear regression would not have worked on datetime type. But the red line represents the linear correlation between 
timestamp and created_at (if one increases so does the other).
