Q1.
NumPy works like a c array in python whilst panda works in strucutred dataframe. I felt NumPy was highly complex and therefore highly malleable 
and might have more transformation and functions in general compared to pandas. Pnadas was more structured and easily comprehensible and therefore was 
easier to read  and simply implemented. 

Q2.
41.9 ms ± 1.28 ms per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 10 loops each)
835 ms ± 277 ms per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 1 loop each)

Possibly because inbuilt functions of pandas libraries are highly optimized (especially at 
handling large databases). It also utilizes C-strings and has no loops.
