1. With the test p-values were more or less not less than 0.05 effectively rejecting the null hypothesis about the new interface being preffered.
We might be p hacking when we segment the data to get a kind of result that verifies the hypothesis.
2.
We would need 21 tests. The probability would be around 0.660, this value is questionable, instead we could calculate new effective alpha as 0.05/21 = 0.00238095238
